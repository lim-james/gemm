# GEMM
`experimental C++26`, `SIMD`, `matrix multiplication`

> Another low latency experiment ported over because its deserves its own repository

## Motivation

Working with [SWAR](https://github.com/lim-james/swar-stoi) wasn't enough, I
wanted to experience the true SIMD benefits. Was an opportunity to be exposed to
cpp26 documentations and experimental features.
